<h2>WEB이란 무엇일까?</h2>
<p>
  WorldWideWeb (later renamed to Nexus to avoid confusion between the software and the World Wide Web) is the first web browser[1] and web page editor.[2] It was discontinued in 1994. At the time it was written, it was the sole web browser in existence,[1] as well as the first WYSIWYG HTML editor.

The source code was released into the public domain on 30 April 1993.[3][4] Some of the code still resides on Tim Berners-Lee's NeXT Computer in the CERN museum and has not been recovered due to the computer's status as a historical artifact.[5] To coincide with the 20th anniversary of the research center giving the web to the world, a project began in 2013 at CERN to preserve this original hardware and software associated with the birth of the Web.[6]

History
Tim Berners-Lee wrote what would become known as WorldWideWeb on a NeXT Computer[4] during the second half of 1990, while working for CERN, a European nuclear research agency. The first successful build was completed by 25 December 1990, after two months of development.[7] The browser was announced on the newsgroups and became available to the general public in August 1991.[7][8] By this time, several others, including Bernd Pollermann, Robert Cailliau, Jean-François Groff,[9] and visiting undergraduate student Nicola Pellow – who later wrote the Line Mode Browser – were involved in the project.[7]
